# automatic-image-brightness-adjustment
An automatic adjustment model is developed for brightness adjustment in images.


Este repositorio contiene el entrenamiento de un modelo para poder ajustar automáticamente le brillo de las fotografías dado un dataset determinado. 

## Problema: 
A photography studio has thousands of photographs that they take at different events: concerts, conferences, shows, public events, etc. Some photographs are too dark or too bright, so they have to spend time manually adjusting the brightness to an optimal level, by hand, wasting many hours and a lot of precious time that could be spent editing the image in a more interesting way. The studio provides you with a data set with thousands of images that have already been adjusted for brightness, your job is to provide a way to automatically adjust the brightness for new images for the studio.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 8758 images of 128 px x 128 px in RGB format.
